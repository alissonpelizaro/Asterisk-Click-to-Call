# Asterisk Click-to-Call (PHP)
Asterisk-Click-to-Call project is a simple and pure PHP script that is able to send a click-to-call signal to an Asterisk Server.

## Dependencies
This script don't depends any JavaScript or Php Library to work. Just need the right values of your Asterisk Server.

## How does it work?
First of all, you must define your server IP, port and a username (ramal) that is already created in your Asterisk. After, the script will open a socket tunnel to try autenticate in your server. If the autenticate occured without problems, the script will send a Click-to-Call for the number setted in the code.

That's it... really simple!

I hope this helps you somehow.
Good Luck!
