# Asterisk Click-to-Call (PHP)
Asterisk-Click-to-Call project is a simple and pure PHP script to send a click-to-call signal through Asterisk Server using any browser.

## Dependencies
This script don't depends any JavaScript or Php Library to work. Just need the right values of your Asterisk Server.

## How does it work?
Before anything, you must set your IP server, port and an username (ramal) that already've been created into your Asterisk. After, the script will open a Socket to try autenticate in your server. If the autenticate occured without problems, the script send a Click-to-Call for the number setted in the code.

That's it... really simple!

I hope it help you.
Good Luck!
